# Phonebook_Management_with_Hashtable

## The Main aim of the program is to compare the time performance of Sorting Algorithms and Sequential Search vs. Binary Search.

This C++ program implements a phonebook management system using Binary Search (BS) and Sequential Search data structures. It provides functionalities for sorting and measuring the performance of various search and sort algorithms. This README will help you understand the program, how to use it, and the key features it offers. First, we use sorting algorithms to sort the phonebook then we take a query from the user and search it through using Sequential Search and Binary Search(to compare them).

## Overview
This program serves as a phonebook management tool, allowing users to perform various operations on their contacts. It includes the following functionalities:

## Perform Operations:

Searching, sorting, and measuring performance.

## Program Flow

### Load Phonebook Data:

Read contact information from the specified input file and create a vector of contacts.
Measure and display the time taken to create a sorted copy of the vector.

### Sort the Phonebook:

Sort the original phonebook vector using various sorting algorithms:
Quick Sort
Merge Sort
Heap Sort
Insertion Sort
Measure and display the execution times for sorting algorithms.

### Search Contacts:

Allow users to search for contacts by entering a full or partial name.
Display matching contacts for both Binary Search and Sequential Search.

## Performance Measurement:

Measure and display the execution times of search algorithms (Binary Search and Sequential Search).
Calculate and display the speedup ratios between different sorting algorithms.
